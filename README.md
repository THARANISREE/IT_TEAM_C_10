                         ABSTRACT
Features extracted from high spatial resolution satellite imagery accurately estimate
economic well-being. This paper investigates this question by extracting object and
texture features from satellite images of Salem, which are used to estimate the economic
wellbeing.In this work, I develop deep learning computer vision methods that can predict
a region's poverty level from an overhead satellite image. The situation is changing with
the advent of very-high-resolution (VHR) imaging sensors . The change makes it possible
to use computer vision techniques to analyze ofman-made structures. This dissertation
aims at developing computer vision and machine learning algorithms
for high resolution aerial imagery analysis in the context of application problems
including,building detection High resolution satellite imagery contains plenty of
information which is not able to be directly understood by a computer while it can be
easily understood by the human vision system. Since computer vision aims to model,
duplicate and exceed the abilities of human vision system through electrical hardware and
computational models it can make important contributions to the analysis of remote
sensing or aerial imagery. The purpose of this research is to develop computer vision and
machine learning algorithms for understanding high resolution satellite imagery. We
experiment with daytime imagery. The features that were extracted include the number
and density of buildings population density, vegetation Cover, building density, land use,
forest, water bodies, road and spectral features calculated using a non-overlapping box
approach. A simple linear regression model , using only these inputs as explanatory
variables. In comparison, models built using day-time lights explain variation in
economic wellbeing of a region. In this project, we test the hypothesis that deep learning
can leverage satellite imagery to reliably predict the economic level of a region. We
assemble a dataset of 7,880 images from Salem city, Tamil Nadu, India.
For Salem city, we obtain a daytime satellite image.Then train Convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) to predict a city's economic wellbeing from the given a satellite image
